# ERC-20 Degen Token Contract

This Solidity program demonstrates an ERC-20 Token with support for the transfer, minting, and burning of tokens, as well as additional gaming and in-game item functionalities.

## Description

The Solidity contract `DegenToken` defines an ERC-20 token with essential functionalities such as minting, burning, and transferring tokens. It also includes a system for purchasing and redeeming in-game items. Additionally, users can participate in a simple game where they bet tokens on random outcomes. The contract uses the OpenZeppelin library for security and follows the ERC-20 standard.

# Contract Overview
The `DegenToken` contract is a basic implementation of an ERC-20-like token with additional game-related features. It includes the following components:

1) **`owner`**: The owner's address is set when the contract is deployed, allowing them to mint new tokens and add game items.

2) **`items`**: A mapping that stores in-game items available for purchase using tokens, each with a unique `itemId`, name, and price.

3) **`playerItems`**: A mapping that tracks which items have been purchased by each user.

# Usage

### Constructor

The contract constructor initializes the token with an initial supply and assigns the deploying address as the owner. The owner can also mint new tokens or add in-game items.

Functions

mint(address to, uint256 amount);
// Allows the contract owner to mint new tokens and add them to a specified address's balance.

burn(uint256 amount);
// Allows users to burn (destroy) a specific amount of their tokens.

transferToken(address recipient, uint256 amount);
// Allows users to transfer a specified amount of tokens from sender to recipient.

welcomeBonus();
// Allows new users to claim a welcome bonus of 50 tokens, but only if they have a zero balance.

addItem(string memory _name, uint256 _price);
// Allows the owner to add new in-game items to the system, with a unique ID and price in tokens.

isLessThanFive(bool _prediction, uint256 _betAmount);
// A simple game where users bet tokens on whether a random number (0-9) is less than 5. Winners double their bet.

purchaseItem(uint8 _itemId);
// Allows users to purchase in-game items using tokens, reducing their balance and storing the purchased items in `playerItems`.

getUserItems(address user) external view returns (uint8[] memory);
// Returns a list of item IDs purchased by a specific user.

getItemName(uint8 _id) external view returns (string memory);
// Retrieves the name of a specific item by its itemId.

getItemPrice(uint8 _id) external view returns (uint256);
// Retrieves the price of a specific item by its itemId.

getBalance() external view returns (uint256);
// Allows users to check their token balance.

burnToken(uint _amount) external;
// Allows users to burn a specified amount of their tokens.
